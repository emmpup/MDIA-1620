# MDIA-1620
For my MDIA 1620 code.

By Emily Misola

## 3, 2, 1's from week 3
### 3 things I learned:
1. Read the error to find out how to solve it. ex, the error said run: git config --global user.email "you@example.com" along with other things, but if I ran that command and put in my email, it worked.
2. `git clone` - copies a version of my repositry
3. `git status` - prints out the status of my local repo
### 2 things confusing:
1. Why do I need to git add, then git commit, then git push when I want to save stuff to git?
2. If you don't need to add the ";" after each line, why would you do that?
### 1 word for how you're feeling:
- releif

## Lesson 6 
### 3 confusing things:
1. What am I supposed to say when reviewing code?
2. Is there a way to see what someone else has said when reviewing code?
3. n/a

### 3 things I have a solid understanding of:
1. Variables
2. Operators
3. Console.log
