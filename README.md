# MDIA-1620
For my MDIA 1620 code.

## Aha moments:
1. cd ~ brings you to your home/main folder
2. dir or ls lets you see everything inside of a folder you are at
3. cd .. brings you back to your previous folder

## Things that are still unclear
1. Why would you use the terminal to find folders instead of the regular folder interface?
2. How repositories work and what they mean

## word for how I'm feeling about all this
- optimistic
